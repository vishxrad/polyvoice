1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Allow me to introduce you to Itana.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,700
She's an Instagram model from Barcelona who's been going viral,

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,100
but she's also just like totally chill and down to earth.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,740
She's into fitness and video games,

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:09,980
and yeah, if you're wondering,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,500
she does have additional photos on our subscription tier,

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,439
which brings in about 10 grand per month.

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,699
Before you sign up though, there's one thing I need to disclose,

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,859
and it really shouldn't matter unless you're some kind of bigot technophobic Nazi,

10
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,600
but she's not a biological female.

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,760
She is a woman, but entirely artificial.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,560
It is November 29th, 2023, and you're watching The Code Report.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,000
By the end of this video, you'll know how to build your own army of AI influencers

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,100
entirely for free using open source generative image models

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,200
like Stable Diffusion XL and checkpoints like Juggernaut

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
that can produce highly realistic images.

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
The first generative adversarial networks appeared about 10 years ago,

18
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,120
and at first could only produce tiny images that you could barely make out.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,020
But now anyone can produce high resolution realistic images

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,680
good enough to trick sad lonely men into buying the NSFW content.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,640
It's extremely sad and depressing that the agency behind this thing

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,259
is making a six-figure income, especially during the sacred month of No Nut November.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,520
Content like this is rotting the brains of billions of men around the world,

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,799
although they are doing a 50% off sale right now,

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
so it does look like a pretty good value actually.

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,140
Luckily, 95% of this channel is comprised of high-value alpha males,

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,379
which means we don't need to consume content like that.

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,420
Instead, we reverse-engineer it so we can exploit it for financial gain.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,519
There are many tools out there that can help you become an AI PIMP,

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,519
like you might be familiar with Midjourney and Dolly from OpenAI,

31
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,219
but these are paid, closed-source products that also contain a bunch of unwanted safety layers.

32
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,560
Luckily, there's a great open-source ecosystem around generative AI.

33
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,519
The most well-known base model is Stable Diffusion XL, which was released in late July 2023.

34
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,519
Gigantic models like this take an absurd amount of computing power,

35
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,939
but luckily it's possible to fine-tune them by creating what's called a checkpoint

36
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,340
using some additional specialized training data.

37
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, you don't have to worry about this part,

38
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,479
because people have already created a bunch of different checkpoints,

39
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,420
which you can find on websites like Civit AI, some of which are highly optimized for photorealism.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,439
Now, the next part of the puzzle is finding a UI where we can actually work with these models

41
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,840
without having to write any code.

42
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,540
The most well-known option is the Stable Diffusion Web UI.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,040
It's an incredibly powerful tool, but might be a little overwhelming for a beginner.

44
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,000
There's just a lot of different buttons to push.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,280
Another cool option is Comfy UI, which has a drag-and-drop editor

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,659
that works kind of like Blender or Unreal Engine,

47
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,020
but the one I'm using in this video is Focus, or Foucus,

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,879
and I'll explain why I like it in just a minute.

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,219
You'll notice all these AI UIs look very similar,

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,560
and that's because they're based on another open-source project called Gradio.

51
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,979
And an interesting side note is that Gradio builds the front-end with Svelte.

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,460
Pretty cool, but let's get started.

53
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,840
Check out the install instructions, but basically all you do is clone the repo,

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,079
create a virtual environment for Python, and install the packages.

55
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,379
Once that's done, you run this Python script,

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,460
which will then automatically download the default models in the background.

57
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,340
These files are multiple gigabytes large, so it may take a while.

58
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,519
The base model is Juggernaut XL, which is based on Stable Diffusion,

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
and works pretty well for realistic images.

60
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:51,020
You now have the power at your fingertips to prompt out any image you can imagine.

61
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,320
The thing I like about Focus is that in many ways it feels similar to Mid Journey,

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,480
but it's free and the UI is way more intuitive.

63
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm running it with a modest NVIDIA 3070,

64
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,500
and it usually takes about 45 seconds to generate two quality images.

65
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,939
What's really cool though is that if you click on the Advanced tab,

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,600
you'll get options for Performance, Aspect, Ratio, and the number of images,

67
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,500
but there's also a tab for Style,

68
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,960
and we can mix and match these different styles to get far different results,

69
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,959
like this retro video game style, or maybe an anime style.

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,900
But in order to generate our AI Influencer,

71
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,180
I'm going to go with the default settings along with Focus, Photograph,

72
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,680
create a prompt that's highly specific,

73
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,180
and add some imperfections like rough skin, no makeup, etc. to make it more realistic.

74
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:29,900
And now our Influencer is born.

75
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,919
Now let's go ahead and save this as our base image,

76
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,879
then create a new prompt and check the box for Input Image.

77
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,460
Drop the base image here to blend multiple images and text together.

78
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,079
Now click on the Advanced box below the image to fine-tune the way the image is blended.

79
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,639
In this case, we'll go with Face Swap,

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,139
and then write a text prompt of doing yoga at the beach,

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,840
giving us that perfect shot for the gram.

82
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,859
But most importantly, we have pretty good continuity between the faces,

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,819
and the hands almost look totally realistic.

84
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,840
But when you have imperfections, you can go back to the Image prompt,

85
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,960
but this time go to Inpaint or Outpaint,

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,139
and then paint across the parts that are messed up.

87
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,180
Tell it what you want to fix,

88
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,139
then it will regenerate those parts of the image.

89
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,280
Congratulations, you just built your own artificial Influencer.

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,320
You did it!

91
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,080
But photos are only the beginning.

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,360
Yesterday, Pika Labs released an insane video demoing their text-to-video platform.

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,120
It's closed source,

94
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,960
but luckily Stability AI just introduced stable diffusion video last week,

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,100
and I can only imagine what kind of depraved content you guys will use that for.

96
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,139
This has been The Code Report,

97
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,080
thanks for watching,

98
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,680
and I will see you in the next one.
