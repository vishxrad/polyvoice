00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Allow me to introduce you to Itana. She's an Instagram model from Barcelona who's been going viral,

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,800
but she's also just like totally chilling down to earth. She's into fitness and video games,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
and yeah, if you're wondering, she does have additional photos on our subscription tier,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
which brings in about 10 grand per month. Before you sign up though, there's one thing I need to

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,920
disclose, and it really shouldn't matter unless you're some kind of bigot technophobic Nazi,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
but she's not a biological female. She is a woman, but entirely artificial. It is November 29th,

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
2023, and you're watching the code report. By the end of this video, you'll know how to build

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:35,359
your own army of AI influencers, entirely for free using open source generative image models like

9
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,320
stable diffusion XL and checkpoints like juggernaut that can produce highly realistic images. The first

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,560
generative adversarial networks appeared about 10 years ago, and at first could only produce tiny

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,120
images that you could barely make out. But now anyone can produce high resolution realistic images

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,079
good enough to trick sad lonely men into buying the NSFW content. It's extremely sad and depressing

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,159
that the agency behind this thing is making a six figure income, especially during the sacred

14
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,159
month of no nut November. Content like this is rotting the brains of billions of men around the

15
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,239
world. Although they are doing a 50% off sale right now, so it does look like a pretty good value

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,879
actually. Luckily 95% of this channel is comprised of high value alpha males, which means we don't

17
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,640
need to consume content like that. Instead, we reverse engineer it so we can exploit it for

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,120
financial gain. There are many tools out there that can help you become an AI PIMP, like you might be

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,000
familiar with mid journey and dolly from open AI, but these are paid close source products that

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,480
also contain a bunch of unwanted safety layers. Luckily, there's a great open source ecosystem

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,200
around generative AI. The most well known base model is stable diffusion XL, which was released

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
in late July 2023. Gigantic models like this take an absurd amount of computing power, but luckily

23
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,159
it's possible to fine tune them by creating what's called a checkpoint using some additional

24
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
specialized training data. Now you don't have to worry about this part because people have already

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
created a bunch of different checkpoints, which you can find on websites like civet AI, some of which

26
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,959
are highly optimized for photo realism. Now the next part of the puzzle is finding a UI where we

27
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,119
can actually work with these models without having to write any code. The most well known option is

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,439
the stable diffusion web UI. It's an incredibly powerful tool, but might be a little overwhelming

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
for a beginner. There's just a lot of different buttons to push. Another cool option is comfy UI,

30
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,159
which has a drag and drop editor that works kind of like blender or Unreal Engine. But the one I'm

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,039
using in this video is focus or focus, and I'll explain why I like it in just a minute. You'll

32
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,039
notice all these AI UIs look very similar, and that's because they're based on another open

33
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,359
source project called a Gradio. And an interesting side note is that Gradio builds the front end

34
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,519
with Svelte. Pretty cool, but let's get started. Check out the install instructions, but basically

35
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,239
all you do is clone the repo, create a virtual environment for Python, and install the packages.

36
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,479
Once that's done, you run this Python script, which will then automatically download the default

37
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,639
models in the background. These files are multiple gigabytes large, so it may take a while. The base

38
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,119
model is Juggernaut XL, which is based on stable diffusion and works pretty well for realistic

39
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:51,279
images. You now have the power at your fingertips to prompt out any image you can imagine. The thing

40
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:55,679
I like about focus is that in many ways it feels similar to mid-journey, but it's free and the UI

41
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:00,479
is way more intuitive. I'm running it with a modest NVIDIA 3070, and it usually takes about 45

42
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,239
seconds to generate two quality images. What's really cool though is that if you click on the

43
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,199
Advanced tab, you'll get options for performance, aspect ratio, and the number of images. But there's

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,919
also a tab for style, and we can mix and match these different styles to get far different results,

45
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,959
like this retro video game style, or maybe an anime style. But in order to generate our AI influencer,

46
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
I'm going to go with the default settings along with focus, photograph, create a prompt that's

47
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,319
highly specific, and add some imperfections like rough skin, no makeup, etc. to make it more realistic.

48
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,319
And now our influencer is born. Now let's go ahead and save this as our base image, then create a

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,519
new prompt and check the box for input image. Drop the base image here to blend multiple images

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,680
and text together. Now click on the advanced box below the image to fine-tune the way the image is

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
blended. In this case we'll go with face swap and then write a text prompt of doing yoga at the

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
beach, giving us that perfect shot for the gram. But most importantly, we have pretty good continuity

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,320
between the faces, and the hands almost look totally realistic. But when you have imperfections,

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,960
you can go back to the image prompt, but this time go to in-paint or out-paint, and then paint across

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,640
the parts that are messed up. Tell it what you want to fix, then it will regenerate those parts of

56
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,239
the image. Congratulations, you just built your own artificial influencer. You did it! But photos

57
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,879
are only the beginning. Yesterday, Pika Labs released an insane video demoing their text-to-video

58
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,919
platform. It's closed source, but luckily stability AI just introduced stable diffusion video last week,

59
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,360
and I can only imagine what kind of depraved content you guys will use that for. This has

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,719
been The Code Report, thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.
