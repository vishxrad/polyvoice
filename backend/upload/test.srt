00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
BREAKING NEWS!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A local developer forgets how to iterate over a list in Java after five years of experience as a Java backend developer.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Witnesses say they were last seen frantically Googling how to increment an iterator in Java before vanishing into the abyss of Stack Overflow.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you've ever felt like an absolute fraud despite, you know, actually writing code that works, congratulations, you have imposter syndrome.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And guess what? Every real developer has it.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you don't wake up at least once a week thinking, wait, do I actually know how to code or have I just been faking it really well?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're a phony!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then you, my friend, are either a liar or an AI-generated LinkedIn guru.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here's the thing, nobody actually knows what they're doing.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You think senior devs just know how everything works?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nah, they're just better at Googling it without looking like they're Googling it.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Trust me, the same people who write billion dollar infrastructure still have to Google how to exit Vim.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And don't even get me started on centering a div.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Some of the smartest engineers in the world are out here losing battles to CSS like it's an Elden Ring boss fight.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Meanwhile, Chad from your boot camp is already pitching his AI-powered crypto startup.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Imposter syndrome is just part of being a developer.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A 2020 study found that over 58% of software engineers admit to feeling like frauds at some point in their careers.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The other, 42%, probably too scared to admit it.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Even Guido Van Rossum, the guy who literally invented Python, once said he doesn't always feel like he knows what he's doing.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So yeah, if the creator of an entire programming language feels like an imposter sometimes, you are definitely allowed to panic over a missing semicolon.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But here's the truth no one tells you. Tech moves too fast for anyone to actually keep up.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
One day, you're a React expert. The next day, React announces React Quantum.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And suddenly you need to unlearn everything you've ever known.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
JavaScript frameworks evolve faster than your ability to understand them.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The moment you finally get comfortable, boom. New release.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Everything's deprecated. And now you have to watch another 12-hour tutorial on YouTube just to feel like a functional human being again.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So if you ever feel like you don't know enough, remember, neither does anyone else.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The only difference between a junior and a senior dev, seniors are just better at hiding their Google searches.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You think that guy in the corner debugging a massive enterprise application isn't copy-pasting Stack Overflow solutions with his whole chest?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Think again. If you can write code, break code, then frantically search for why your code is broken, congratulations, you're a real developer.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And finally, if all else fails, just remember, you're only a fraud if you get caught.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now excuse me while I google how to write a for loop again.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,879
And don't forget to like and subscribe, or you will instantly forget how to center a div.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And these are debating.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So we're going to start seeing those differences in the day that's quite interesting.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And how to this going on.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we can print back in.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So remember...

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then what happens to...

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In our last minute, we're going to bring back into a wild dog and we could have its best.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The pattern of the mouse, you'll see a части of the mouse, it's that of courseВО Night sacks.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Theторовus, something that went along, you can see a kind where your pen is connected, and that it's a small of the mouse.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Of course we have.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So that the discovery is done.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Even if you're beginning this next time we're going to use the dog mode, man.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think only really礙osis, not a good guy thing to do with you, and that didn't trust you.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And again, let's get caught up interestingly, it doesn't get me.
